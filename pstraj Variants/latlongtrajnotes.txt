A few notes about the code:
- I've done my best to comment on what every variable represents/does, but it is very possible I've missed something in the process. If you find something where you don't know what it does, feel free to ask!
- The first section is all of the initial conditions/inputs/constants used throughout the code, the second section contains the radiation pressure functions I used for my paper as well as the core function that the odeint method uses to iterate, the third section is where the backtracing and calculating is done, and the fourth section (optional) is for plotting the resultant trajectories. The sections are delineated by a few lines of empty comments (#).
- As I have it now, the code calculates some key quantities associated with the trajectory (the perihelion, how long it takes the trajectory to reach the target point from 100 au, the attenuated phase space density). These quantities are currently only calculated for trajectories that reach the x = 100 au plane, but I can change this if you want, just let me know. I propagated the code calculating the time in the given ranges so that those should be calculated regardless.
- So far, the relevant quantities are outputted simply as print statements, but if you'd prefer another method of outputting them or you'd like other information about the trajectories to be outputted, let me know.
- The code currently outputs the lengths of time in which the trajectory stays within the given latitude/longitude range as an array of time values in years. I've tried to catch as many edge cases as possible when coding up this function, but if you find one that doesn't work, let me know and I can work on fixing it.
